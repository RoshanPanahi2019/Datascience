This repostitory is dedicated to innovative applications of artificial intelligence in construction industry, to help move our industry forward. 


## RFI Recommender System: 
Unforeseen events lead to incidents, delays, and extra costs for construction projects. This software assists the reviewers to identify similar issues from past projects to reduce the likelihood of unforeseens. 

## Delay Classification: 
Over half of construction projects are delivered with delay. Documented precursors of such delays can be used to identify patterns and predict delays. This project quantifies the impact of such precursors on long-term delays. 

## Comment Classification: 
Construction is a highly manual industry, both for the field crew and the supporting staff. Automation can help shift attention from repetitive tasks to where human attention and capabilities are valued most, such as the safety of construction workers. This project uses artificial intelligence to showcase simple but useful applications of automation in daily tasks.
