# Corelation Matrix for Delay Root Causes

Figure below shows the corelation between the different features of the project, based on 256 projects. Here features F0 to F26 indicate the identified root causes of delay, while the saturated colors indicate higher levels are positive corelation between the features. For example there is a relatively significant positive corelation between F2 ( Change orders) and F4 (Supply chain).
