In this project I will be using Microsoft Azure to build and end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including:

 - Pre-process data using appropriate modules.
 - Train and evaluate a boosted decision tree model on Azure ML Studio.
 - Create scoring and predictive experiments.
 - Deploy the trained model as an Azure web service.
