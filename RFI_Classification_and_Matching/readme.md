## RFI Recommender System:

In this project rule-based and NLP methods are used to classify Request For Information(RFI) data from a construction company into disciplines, and computer vision is used to extract information from drawings. Finally, each drawing is matched with the most related RFI.

## Abstract:
Design reviews are critical for construction projects to reduce costly reworks and future conflicts. However, this is a challenging task due to uncertainties during the initial stages of a project which can lead to numerous Requests for Information (RFIs). With the recent advancements in language models and computer vision, a large volume of historical RFIs can be leveraged to aid design reviews. This study proposes a novel framework using natural language processing, ChatGPT API, and computer vision techniques to identify the RFIs from previous projects that are more likely to reoccur in the project under review. The framework was tested using RFI data from 19 healthcare construction projects, and a web application was used to evaluate user experiences with the tool. Successful implementation of the proposed framework could reduce the number of RFIs, change orders, rework by contractors, and the likelihood of time and cost overruns for construction projects.
